                  <h1>FOLLOW THESE STEPS!</h1>
                  <p>The H-2A visa is a temporary work visa for foreign agricultural workers who will perform seasonal
                     or temporary agricultural work in the United States. Here is an overview of the general process of
                     obtaining an H-2A visa:</p>

                     </div>
                     <p>The U.S. employer must first demonstrate that there are not enough U.S. workers who are able,
                        willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work, and that hiring foreign workers will
                        not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed.</p>

                        meets the minimum requirements set by the DOL.</p>

                        Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), along with supporting documentation and the
                        approved labor certification.</p>

                  <p>It is important to note that the H-2A visa process can be complex, and it is highly recommended

                     all legal requirements.</p>
