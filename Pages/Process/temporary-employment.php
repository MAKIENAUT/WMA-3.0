                        <p>The first step in obtaining
                           temporary employment in the United States is to find an
                           employer who is willing to sponsor you for a temporary work
                           visa. The employer must demonstrate that there are no
                           qualified U.S. workers available for the position and that
                           your employment will not adversely affect the wages and
                           working conditions of U.S. workers in similar positions.</p>

                        <p>Once you have found an
                           employer, they will need to obtain a labor certification
                           from the U.S. Department of Labor. This certification
                           confirms that there are no qualified U.S. workers available
                           for the position and that your employment will not adversely
                           affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers in

                           Petition for Alien Worker, with U.S. Citizenship and
                           Immigration Services (USCIS). This form confirms that you
                           meet the qualifications for the temporary work visa and that
                           the employer has met all the necessary requirements.</p>

                           depending on the specific visa category, but typically
                           involves submitting the Form I-129, Petition for
