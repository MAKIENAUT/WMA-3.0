                  <h1>FOLLOW THESE STEPS!</h1>
                  <p>It's crucial to research and understand the specific family-based immigration policies of the
                     Western country you are interested in, as they can vary significantly. Additionally,
                     immigration policies in these countries may change over time due to evolving political and
                     social factors.</p>

                        <h1>01</h1>
                        <h1>DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY</h1>
                     </div>
                     <p>The first step in the family-based immigration process is to determine if you are eligible to
                        apply. Generally, U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can petition for certain
                        family members to immigrate to the United States.</p>

                     </div>
                     <p>Once you have determined your eligibility, the next step is to file Form I-130, Petition for
                        Alien Relative, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This form establishes
                        the relationship between the petitioner and the intending immigrant and serves as the first
                        step in the immigration process.</p>

                     <p>After submitting the Form I-130, you will need to wait for USCIS to process the petition. The
                        processing time can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the volume of petitions
                        being processed.</p>

                     </div>
                     <p>Once the Form I-130 is approved, the intending immigrant can file Form I-485, Application to
                        Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, if they are already in the United States. If
                        the intending immigrant is outside the United States, they will need to apply for an
                        immigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate.</p>

                     <p>If the intending immigrant is applying for an immigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate,
                        they will be required to attend a visa interview. During the interview, a consular officer
                        will ask questions about the relationship between the petitioner and the intending immigrant,
                        as well as other aspects of the immigrant's background.</p>

                     <p>If the immigrant visa application is approved, the intending immigrant will receive a green
                        card, which grants them permanent residence in the United States. If the intending immigrant
                        filed Form I-485, they will receive the green card after their application is approved.

                  <p>Overall, the family-based immigration process can be complex and time-consuming. It is important to
